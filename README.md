# mr_roboto_Land




This is my first time commiting. I created it using some lessons I have learned along the way. I thought it funny to lovingly mock Mr.Robot. After all why not have some fun. This is the first of many.  

I just wanted to add where I learned about object oriented D&D styled python games. I purchased mikeckennedy course Python Jumpstart By Building 10 apps. Was inspiring and you learn lots. 
Please check out talkpython.fm Great matterial. 



Updated with another level to play after the first loop is over. Next I think I'll automate the transition when I learn how.
