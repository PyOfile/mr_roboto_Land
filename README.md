# mr_roboto_Land




This is my first time commiting. I created it using some lessons I have learned along the way. I thought it funny to lovingly mock Mr.Robot. After all why not have some fun. This is the first of many.  

I just wanted to add where I learned about object oriented D&D styled python games. I purchased mikeckennedy course Python Jumpstart By Building 10 apps. Was inspiring and you learn lots. 
Please check out talkpython.fm Great matterial. 



Update: Added in line loops, to add the levels one after another.

This has seriously been fun. I think my next goal is to update the headers to be more fun. Perhaps add some for leves. Hobby in progress.
